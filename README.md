 ****My-100 Days of Coding Challenge -Back-End Engineering Journey!**

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge repository! This challenge is a personal commitment to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. 
Through this journey, I aim to enhance my coding skills, explore new technologies, and stay consistent in my learning.

**Goals**
- Learn: Dive deep into back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, databases, and authentication mechanisms.
- Build: Create practical projects to apply theoretical knowledge and gain hands-on experience.
- Grow: Improve problem-solving skills, code efficiency, and best practices in back-end development.
- Share: Document my progress, challenges, and insights to inspire others and build a supportive community.


**Getting Started**
Each project will have its own directory within this repository.
